## What's inside?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Fearless Refactoring" icon="seti:ocaml">
    Writing your apps in OCaml helps you prototype quickly and refactor
    fearlessly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batteries Included" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Riot aims to be a productive environment for building I/O heavy
    applications like web servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-core from Day 1" icon="seti:ocaml">
    Riot apps are multicore ready by default. Simply spawn many Riot processes
    and the engine will schedule them across all the available cores.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Faster than Fast" icon="rocket">
    Riot ships with a purpose-built I/O engine to squeeze the every CPU cycle
    and make your apps blazing fast!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Friendly" icon="heart">
    All backgrounds and genders and experience levels are welcome and respected equally.
    Black lives matter. Trans rights are human rights. No nazi bullsh*t.
