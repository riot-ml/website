## Installing Riot

We can install Riot from Github or from the OPAM repository.

```bash frame="code" title="Install with opam"
$ opam pin riot.dev
$ opam install riot
```

```lisp title="Install with dune"
(package
  (name your_package)
  (depends riot))

; if you want to use the latest version from Github
; you can set package pins with the following snippets:
(pin (package (name riot)) (url "git+https://github.com/riot-ml/riot"))
(pin (package (name rio)) (url "git+https://github.com/riot-ml/rio"))
(pin (package (name gluon)) (url "git+https://github.com/riot-ml/gluon"))
(pin (package (name bytestring)) (url "git+https://github.com/riot-ml/bytestring"))
```
